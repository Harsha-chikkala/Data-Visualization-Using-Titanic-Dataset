# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

This project performs a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to uncover hidden patterns, correlations, and trends related to passenger survival.

## 📁 Dataset Description

- **Source**: Titanic dataset (custom formatted)
- **Rows**: 889 passengers
- **Columns**:
  - `PassengerId`: Unique ID for each passenger
  - `Survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
  - `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
  - `Sex`: Gender
  - `Age`: Age in years
  - `SibSp`: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
  - `Parch`: Number of parents/children aboard
  - `Fare`: Ticket fare
  - `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
